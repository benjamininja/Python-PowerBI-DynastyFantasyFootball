## [ ] Active / Next Steps

### Stage A — execute · target ≤35%  ✅ landed + VERIFIED 2026-06-13
- [x] Discord `rankings.py` rewrite (Option A): reads
  `fact_dynasty_ranking_metrics.parquet` (EAV) + `dim_nfl_players.parquet`,
  filters to `{ktc,ds,fp}_positional_rank` for the format, joins on `gsis_id`,
  re-ranks 1..N per displayed group. Replaces read of deleted
  `fact_dynasty_rankings.parquet`. **Verified against regenerated parquet**
  (snapshot 2026-06-13): SF/TEPP/IDP boards build, source default + override,
  position filter, Composite/unknown-position/bad-format all error cleanly.
  Two refinements the live data forced:
  - **Grouping = `position_group`, not `position`.** Granular `position`
    fragments each source's single rank list (FantasyPros ranks DE/DT
    separately) across 11 IDP fields with duplicate #1s. `position_group`
    gives offense QB/RB/WR/TE + IDP DL/LB/DB; offense identical either way.
  - **Re-rank 1..N within each field** (user decision): source sub-position
    ranking disagrees with DL/LB/DB grouping → show a clean sequence; no-op
    for offense. `groupby("position").rank(method="first")`.            · **[med]** ✅
- [x] `04z_fantrax_crosswalk.ipynb` gsis collision (Option B): hard
  `RuntimeError` → soft-fail. Logs `[warn]`, writes colliding rows +
  `action` col to `data/review/review_fantrax_crosswalk_collisions.csv`,
  continues. Crosswalk still written.                   · **[med]** ✅

**Phase 0 — DONE 2026-06-13.** Crystallized: (a) Stage A rankings grouping →
ADR-0002 + data-model + MEMORY index; (b) new-table design → ADR-0003 +
data-model `fact_roster_transactions`/derived `fact_fantasy_teams` section +
MEMORY index. Root tier unchanged (all facts project-specific); harness store
already drained. **Next: COMPACT**, then either the build stage for the new
tables or the `05a`/`04c` grill seams.

### NEW fact tables — design RESOLVED via grill 2026-06-13 (build deferred to own stage)
Foundational design settled (5-Q grill). BUILD is a future multi-step stage AFTER
Phase 0 + compact — do not start now. Sources are Fantrax (league
`v744203wmmvjqzv6`), auth-gated. Full rationale → ADR (written in Phase 0 below).

**`fact_roster_transactions`** (NEW; renamed from `fact_dead_money_drafts`) —
event-sourced player acquisition/transaction ledger.
- Unified fact, `event_type` discriminator: `startup_auction | rookie_draft |
  fa_auction | fa_pickup | resign` (resign = re-sign + franchise tag; add `drop`
  for dead-money realization). New event types add ROWS, not tables.
- Grain: 1 row / acquisition event. Key `season + event_type + team_key +
  gsis_id + event_seq` (pick_no for drafts, txn_date for FA).
- **SSOT** for how / at-what-salary a player was acquired. `fact_fantasy_teams`
  is DERIVED from it (replay → latest active contract per player); derivable from
  startup data alone.
- `contract_value` ← Fantrax salary; `cap_hit` DERIVED by contract type
  (`dim_contract.cap_hit_pct` × value, by `contract_year`) — never stored twice;
  `dead_money` = guaranteed residual; Yo-Yo cap-exempt while `ml_games_left>0`.
- Source: 04a-style Playwright + Fantrax `fxpa/req` (`getDraftResults`-type
  method), persistent `.pw_profile`; full snapshot → replace-by-
  `(season, event_type)`; idempotent. Reuse `etl_helpers` (CFG, crosswalk via
  `dim_fantrax_crosswalk` scorer_id→gsis_id, `load_replace_partition`).
- **Live-draft use case:** run between picks during the startup draft → re-derive
  availability → refresh the 05a `startup_draft_board.xlsx`. v1 = startup auction
  (35 rounds); schema forward-compatible.

**Saturate `fact_fantasy_teams`** — now means BUILD THE DERIVATION (ledger →
current-roster state on the 12-col schema 02b already seeds), NOT an independent
scrape. Feeds `dim_fantasy_teams` cap rollups.

**Draft capital folded in (ADR-0004, grill 2026-06-13):** ledger key
`gsis_id → asset_id` (`season_id + event_type + team_key + asset_id +
event_seq`); new `dim_roster_asset` (player/prospect/pick bridge), `dim_draft_pick`,
`dim_season`. `event_type` += `pick_allocation` (live) + `trade` (dormant v1).
Picks seeded from Fantrax `draftPicks.go` snapshot; `fact_fantasy_teams` derives
pick inventory by replay. v1 = inventory only (valuation deferred).

Open (build-time, not blocking): finalize `event_type` enum incl. `drop`;
roster-page role under ledger-SSOT (recommend defer roster scrape for v1 startup —
no prior roster; use later for in-season status/IR reconciliation); exact
`dead_money` schedule per contract year; 05a availability-join wiring;
**HAR-capture `draftPicks.go` for the `fxpa/req` method + shape; add
`fantrax_team_id` to `dim_fantasy_teams` (Fantrax teamId→team_key; front-runs
task #1); confirm current+2 pick horizon during rookie-draft window; `dim_season`
NFL date lookup; `asset_id` surrogate scheme (sequence vs deterministic hash).**

⟂ after Phase 0 + COMPACT → build stage (own window)

### NEW high-value tasks — ALL GRILLED 2026-06-13 (designs resolved; builds queued)
Decision trees cleared via `/grill-with-docs`. Builds are their own post-compact
stages. Architecturally significant.

1. [x] **Owner manifest sync → Google Sheet — design RESOLVED → ADR-0005.**
   Fantrax = upstream SSOT, Sheet = field-scoped synced mirror. Join on
   `Fantrax-TeamId` (managers not unique). **Locked (never written):** Division,
   Team ID, Fantrax-TeamId. **Synced:** Team Name, Team Abbreviation, Manager
   Email, Other Manager Email. Diff-only writes, soft-fail unmatched. `01c` maps
   `Fantrax-TeamId → fantrax_team_id` (lights up the ADR-0004 ledger join). New
   `dim_division` `(season_id, conference) → name`. ⚠ build: external-write + PII
   gate (explicit go-ahead + Sheets-API auth, owner-set-up). **Build = own stage.**
2. [x] **Ingest draft capital — design RESOLVED via `/grill-with-docs` 2026-06-13
   → ADR-0004.** Picks become first-class assets under a polymorphic `asset_id`
   (`dim_roster_asset` bridges player/prospect/pick); event-sourced in the SAME
   ledger via `pick_allocation`. New dims `dim_draft_pick` (`pick_ref` =
   (draft_season, round, original_owner), stable under trade) + `dim_season`
   (`season_id` `"2026-2027"`). Glossary → root `CONTEXT.md`. **Build folds into
   the `fact_roster_transactions` stage below** (no longer a standalone task).
3. [x] **Source/dependency manifest — ✅ BUILT 2026-06-13 → `docs/SOURCES.md`.**
   Hand-authored, **external-input boundary only** (internal lineage stays in
   data-model `Source` col + README inventory). Cols: Source · URL/locator ·
   Purpose · Auth · Feeds (notebook→table) · Cadence. 9 live rows (Fantrax
   getDraftRanks, Google Sheet, nflverse, KTC, FantasyPros, WalterFootball,
   DraftSharks, DynastySharks, manual Excel) + 3 planned (Fantrax
   getDraftResults/draftPicks.go, commissioner admin, Sheet write-sync). Secrets
   = auth **method** only (no tokens/emails/.env). Anti-drift via the `Feeds`
   column; no generator for v1. · **[med]** ✅

⟂ **COMPACT** — all four grills cleared (04c, 05a, manifest sync, SOURCES.md);
designs crystallized to ADR-0004/0005 + CONTEXT.md + data-model. Then build stages.

### Grill seam — `05a` `METRIC_MAP` keying · RESOLVED → Option A · ✅ BUILT + VERIFIED 2026-06-13
- [x] **Option A: key METRIC_MAP by `metric_key` alone** (dropped the redundant
  `(source, metric_key)` tuple — each key owns one source, data-model:241).
  `load_dynasty_metrics()` loop filters on `metric_key` only; source no longer
  threaded through. **Verified behavior-preserving**: all 13 mapped keys confirmed
  single-source in `fact_dynasty_ranking_metrics` (latest SF snapshot) → dropping
  the `source_name` filter cannot change results. **Rejected full B**: the board's
  subset-selection + display column names are 05a presentation, not registry
  concerns. Registry owns *what metrics are/where from*; 05a owns *which the board
  shows + what it calls them*.   · **[cheap-med]** ✅

### Grill seam — `04c` SEED rank rows · RESOLVED → Option B · ✅ BUILT + VERIFIED 2026-06-13
- [x] **Option B: generate the 6 rank rows from `SOURCE_PREFIX`** (× {overall,
  positional}); the prefix `.upper()` IS the display abbrev (ktc→KTC, ds→DS,
  fp→FP) so no second map needed (simpler than the grill sketch). 28 bespoke
  metric rows stay hand-typed. Makes `etl_helpers.py:544` (which already *claims*
  04c reads SOURCE_PREFIX) true. **Verified**: generated rows byte-identical to
  the prior hand-typed 6; notebook executes clean → 34 rows (6 gen + 28 bespoke),
  validation passes (all fact keys covered).   · **[cheap-med]** ✅

⟂ **COMPACT** — Stage (04c + 05a) landed + verified; SOURCES.md next (light) or
the two heavy stages (ledger / manifest sync, each external-gated).

### Off-thread (user-owned — don't budget against my window)
- [x] Rerun dynasty pipeline on `update-dynasty_metrics-refactor`: delete
  stale `fact_dynasty_rankings.parquet` + `fact_dynasty_ranking_metrics.parquet`,
  rerun `04b → 04x → 04y → 04c`, refresh PBI against regenerated parquet.
  Best done before the Discord rewrite is tested.        · **[user · off-thread]**
- [x] In `pbi/mouserat2`, remove orphaned `Fact_DynastyRankings` table, its 4
  relationships, and stale `cultures/en-US.tmdl` entries (2026-06-12
  refactor leftover).                                     · **[user · off-thread]**

### Cross-branch consistency — check-in (later, can split)
- [ ] Reconcile + commit the architecture-doc edits (`CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`,
  `docs/adr/0001-*`) across all active branches
  (`update-dynasty_metrics-refactor`, `harden-discord-bot`) so the
  convention is consistent everywhere. Some work is still in-progress and may
  need to be **pushed before fully resolved** to keep architecture changes in
  sync across branches — split into per-branch tasks as the grills land.
- [ ] Once Stage A + both grills' code land: commit and open the PR for
  `update-dynasty_metrics-refactor` → `main`.            · **[cheap]**

## [ ] Deferred - User Requested

- [ ] Deploy `discord_bot/` to Railway. Scaffolded per the
  `discord-bot-github-fetch` skill (`railway.json`, crash-loop guards in
  place) but currently runs locally only — deploy once the `rankings.py`
  rewrite above is done and verified against the new EAV schema.
- [ ] Additional Discord bot commands (`player`, `adp` lookups). v1 was
  intentionally scoped to `rankings` only — revisit once `rankings` is
  stable on the new schema.
- [ ] Close out the `git filter-repo` history-scrub follow-up for
  `notebooks/.env` / `data/.pw_profile` (2026-05-30 incident) — user-owned,
  low urgency, not yet fully verified closed.

## [ ] Deferred - Recommended

- [ ] **Revisit: machine-readable `sources.yml` + validation harness** (lower
  priority). Once `docs/SOURCES.md` (task #3) exists and proves useful, consider
  promoting it to a structured `sources.yml` with a lint that checks each
  `Feeds` notebook still references its source URL — rot-proof vs the hand-doc.
  Deferred per owner: door left open, not v1.            · [med]

- [ ] Add the one-line token-gating pointer to `CLAUDE.md` (→
  [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-token-gated-grill-execute-loop.md)) — the ADR's
  Consequences section already assumes it's there.            · [cheap]
- [x] `notebooks/README.md` 04b inventory row + "two-layer model" section
  updated to the single-EAV-fact design (ADR-0002, 2026-06-12 refactor):
  `fact_dynasty_rankings` backbone retired, ranks fold into
  `fact_dynasty_ranking_metrics` as source-prefixed metric_keys;
  `dim_dynasty_crosswalk` + `dim_dynasty_metric` retained. ✅ 2026-06-13
- [x] The `discord-bot-github-fetch` skill's `references/data-model.md`
  rewritten to the EAV + `position_group` board (ADR-0002), grounded in the
  shipped `discord_bot/rankings.py`: single `fact_dynasty_ranking_metrics`
  fact, `{ktc,ds,fp}_positional_rank` keys, identity join to `dim_nfl_players`
  on `gsis_id`, re-rank 1..N per group, `_PREFERRED_SOURCE` defaults. Retired
  `fact_dynasty_rankings`/`position_raw` references removed. ✅ 2026-06-13
  (Skill file, outside the repo: `~/.claude/skills/discord-bot-github-fetch/`.)
- [ ] `04z`'s divergent `clean_player_name` copy (apostrophe/suffix handling
  differs from `etl_helpers.clean_player_name`) can under-match its
  secondary `player_key` lookup — known open item per data-model.md.
  Consolidate once the gsis soft-fail change above lands.
- [ ] Sweep `01b`-`01e`, `02b`, `03y`, `04a` for local `LeagueConfig`-style
  constants that duplicate what's now in `etl_helpers` (`CFG`,
  `SOURCE_PREFIX`, `ZERO_IS_MISSING`, `fold_ranks_long`) and consolidate.
- [ ] Confirm whether `.claude/settings.local.json` (currently tracked)
  should be gitignored like other Claude Code local-settings files, or is
  intentionally shared across the team.

## [ ] Deferred - Future

- [ ] In-season tables: `fact_nfl_player_stats`, `fact_nfl_season_injuries`
  (nflreadpy weekly stats/injuries) — per data-model.md "In-Season Tables
  (deferred)".
- [ ] Fabric migration: swap `pd.read/write_parquet` for
  `spark.read.parquet` / `abfss://` once the dynasty model has settled —
  schema is already designed to be migration-neutral.
- [ ] Prep-for-AI / Fabric Data Agent configuration for the dynasty
  semantic model (per the `semantic-modeling-prepforai` skill), once the
  dynasty refactor and PBI model cleanup are done.
- [ ] Generalize composite ADP blending (`ADP_KEYS`) beyond 2 sources if/
  when a 3rd ADP source is added.
