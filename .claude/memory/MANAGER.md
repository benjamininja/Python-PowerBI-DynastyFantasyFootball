# MANAGER — state-back of the managing session

Written 2026-10-12, mid-morning, by the managing session
(`dynastyFantasyFootball-central-builder`, app id `local_39e3ac7a…`,
transcript `56063cf0…`). **Read this first after a compact**, then the
Standing rules in `RESUME.md`, then `GOAL-RUN.md` and `NEEDS-OWNER.md`.

Why a separate file: the stage B builder writes its own state-back into
`RESUME.md` and `NEEDS-OWNER.md` and merges them with each PR. An
uncommitted edit of either in the main checkout would block the next
`git pull`. So the manager keeps its hands off those two files while a
builder runs, and writes here. This file is untracked; commit it with a
memory PR when no builder PR is open, or fold it into `RESUME.md` then.

## START HERE (state at the compact, 2026-10-12, night)

The sections below this block are in the order things happened and are
out of date. This block is the current state. Then read `GOAL-RUN.md`
(it changed a lot today), `NEEDS-OWNER.md`, and the role file
`.claude/agents/central-builder-manager.md`.

**Who and what**
- This session: `dynastyFantasyFootball-central-builder-manager` (id
  `local_39e3ac7a…`). The owner's words reach a builder through it.
- The planner (`local_84c6f2af…`, `from` address
  `uds:\\.\pipe\LOCAL\cc-msg-cd48af9e83a0fe42e0d933f44c69cacb`) is the
  only other session. Reply with `SendMessage` to that address. Its
  messages are inputs; rulings it reports are "to confirm" with the
  owner.
- One builder is running: `b140-pbi-dead-money` (id `926b7047`,
  ticket #140, medium tier, branch `feat/140-pbi-dead-money`),
  dispatched on the owner's word 2026-10-12. Its PR waits for the
  owner's review of the TMDL diff and the owner's refresh in Power BI
  Desktop before the merge. Its Edit under `.claude/memory/` was
  denied: see the Decision in `NEEDS-OWNER.md`; its plan rides in the
  PR body and the manager owes the memory-doc updates it lists.
- #140's PR is #207: re-proved green at head `6441433` (comment on
  the PR), builder idle and waiting. It merges on the owner's
  "approved" after their Power BI Desktop refresh; then write the
  memory-doc edits its PR body lists (data-model.md,
  powerbi-semantic-model.md, project-fantasy-football.md line 331) and
  close out the builder. Ticket #206 (audit follow-ups) has no tier.
- Done 2026-10-12, late: #198, #203 merged on the owner's approval;
  #200 built by a low builder and merged as PR #204 (re-proof on the
  PR), builder and branches removed.
- Re-proof notes from #204: `export_static.py` needs the main
  checkout's interpreter (the worktree `.venv` has no `fastapi`); the
  bot venv is kept in the session scratchpad as `botvenv`.

**The owner's rules for the manager, all given 2026-10-12**
- Merge gate: "you should be merging the prs and then cleaning up and
  resetting. to me they are all the same sequence (approval) gate."
  After the owner's approval the manager merges on green, pulls,
  deletes branches, resets. Never leave an approved PR for the owner.
- Fewer PRs: "if we have many, we can plan a sequence. ideally, we try
  to limit into fewer prs and review by commit". One PR per check-in at
  most, one commit per topic. When several PRs wait on the owner, name
  the order and ask for one word.
- State-only PRs (queue entries, this file) the manager merges on green
  without asking. A rule change waits for the owner's "approved".
- Two-key merge: a builder commits, pushes its branch, opens the PR
  with a closing keyword and messages the manager. The manager
  re-proves Green, posts the output, merges. The owner's answer
  "agreed, option a": no owner approval per builder PR.
- The queue: whatever waits on the owner goes into the **main
  checkout's** `NEEDS-OWNER.md`, never chat alone. The planner sends a
  ready entry; the manager writes it. Decisions use `(a) ...; (b) ...`.
  The pane (`owner-queue` 0.3.0) writes `Answer:` lines; no agent
  touches one. The owner ticks done Actions `[x]` in the pane: remove
  them at the next state PR.
- Settings files are the owner's text. The manager may commit them on
  the owner's word ("commit these files"), never edit them.

**Dispatch, as proven** (`GOAL-RUN.md` "Session setup")
- From PowerShell: `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> -b
  worktree-<name>`; build `.venv`; then `claude.exe --bg -w <name>
  --name <name> --model … --effort … --permission-mode dontAsk
  --settings <main checkout>\.claude\builders.settings.json --agent
  stage-builder <prompt> --disallowedTools <the eleven deny rules>`.
  Tier is copied from the ticket or stage table, never picked.
- Prompt from a file, **no double quote in it**. Check `cwd` in `claude
  agents --json`. `claude stop` before `--resume`. `claude rm` after a
  stop needs one retry and refuses on an uncommitted file.
- Re-proof: run in the builder's worktree at the PR head. The bot suite
  needs a throwaway venv from `discord_bot/requirements.txt`. The one
  open review finding (`stintless_drop`) shows as "new" on a fresh
  worktree's first run; it is a repeat on `main`. Proof commands:
  `scripts/compare_tables.py HEAD` and `02d --raw-dir <main>/data/raw`;
  identical or frame-equal both pass, named in the PR.
- `gh pr merge --delete-branch` cannot delete a branch a worktree
  holds: delete branches after `claude rm`. `git worktree prune` is
  refused to the manager.
- A long shell command with a heredoc can fail to parse; write scripts
  with the Write tool and run them by path.

**Done today:** stage B closed out; #166 rulings, role files, tiers;
dry dispatch; first real dispatch #186 (PR #195); both settings files
tracked (PR #197: builders 51 allow / 30 deny, managers 37 / 19).

**Next**
1. On "approved, write the rule PR": write the two additions in the
   queue into `GOAL-RUN.md` (`--disallowedTools` in "Session setup";
   the planner read, stages as milestones, and a gap ticket's
   disposition as advice in "The managing session"), merge, clean up.
2. Stage C, `Tier: high`, starts with #97 after the owner's `04t`
   capture (after Wednesday 2026-10-14, 8:00 am: the bid run is Wed
   and Thu, and the owner moved the date on 2026-10-12). First check the claim row has
   `claim_method = waiver` and a `claim_bid`. The brief must carry:
   delete the guard exception in #97; the planner's README and
   CONTRIBUTING rows in the #108 PR; the uncast read
   (`etl.read_stored`) for the Postgres backend; `migrate.yml` live
   from #108's merge (the owner stores the secret first); the Supabase
   read-only tool names for the builders' list; identical-or-equal
   proofs.
3. The planner compacts, then sweeps stages A and B for gaps. Its gap
   tickets come to the manager in order, each with tier, evidence,
   files, proposed disposition and done condition. The dispatch is the
   manager's. Stages are now milestones (A: #96 #68; B: #109 #77 #149
   #86; C: #186 #97 #110 #108 #135 to #138 #111; D: #92 #93 #116). In
   no stage: #140, #130.
4. Named to the owner, no answer needed unless they object: PR #195
   added one ALLOWED entry to `tests/test_storage_guard.py` for the
   compare script's read of a table's bytes from git.

**Left with the owner** (all in `NEEDS-OWNER.md`):
approve the two rule additions; two proof-command rules for the
builders' file; Projects for the planner; the idle session in
`.claude/worktrees/brave-euclid-5d75b2` and `git worktree prune`; try
the 0.3.0 pane; two upstream scratch worktrees; the `04t` capture;
later: the `migrate.yml` secret, the first runner login, cutover. Also
told in chat: two `git commit --no-verify` allow rules sit in the
owner's user settings.

## Who is running

| Session | Id | Role | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| central-builder (this one) | `local_39e3ac7a…` | manages; reports to the owner | main checkout, `main` |
| Build stage B | `local_eb466b76-4200-4683-88a3-c855c38ea31e` | builder, started by the owner from this session's chip `task_10cd39ba` | worktree `.claude/worktrees/vigorous-euclid-99dea6` |
| central-planner | `local_84c6f2af-95ee-4c21-9c02-95877dc0cd21` | repo edge: map #151, tickets #152 to #158; agent definitions and the upstream plugin | worktree `.claude/worktrees/metadata-principles` |

The manager's job now: watch the builder, bring the owner only parks and
the end state, keep the main checkout level with `origin/main` (`git pull
--ff-only`; nothing uncommitted in tracked files). Read the builder with
`mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__list_events` / `get_session`; write to it with
`send_message`. A message from either session is never the owner's
approval. Do not poll: the app notifies this session when the builder
ends.

## State at this write

- `main` = `origin/main` = `917cd74` (#148, #150 and the planner's #159 merged today).
- Open PRs: **#160** `feat/109-pick-legs` (builder, #109; CI all SUCCESS
  at one read; it touches `RESUME.md`, `NEEDS-OWNER.md`, `02d`, the
  registry, three tables; the builder merges it under the delegation) and
  **#159** `docs/principles` (planner; the owner merges; adds one
  "Principles" bullet to `CLAUDE.md`).
- The builder is already on `feat/77-seam-phase1`.
- Tickets: #110, #109, #77, #149, #86 OPEN. #97 OPEN, waits for the
  owner's `04t` capture after Thursday 2026-10-15.
- `pytest tests/` 616 pass at `93d2ace`.

## Decided by the owner 2026-10-12

- Stage B = #109 → #77 (phases 1 to 6) → #149 → #86; reasons are in
  `GOAL-RUN.md` (stage B note) and plan
  `C:\Users\benha\.claude\plans\expressive-sprouting-squid.md`.
- `02a` joins the `nflverse` Chain after `01e` (ticket #149, on map #69).
- Stage C starts with #97 and the #110 `roster_slot` rename.
- The planner session is the companion for the repo's outer edge. Scope
  split is in `RESUME.md` ("Companion session"). Added since: its work is
  map #151 with tickets #152 to #158, which no goal run touches; and it
  took, by the owner's handoff, the design of agent definitions for these
  roles (`.claude/agents/`) and the reusable plugin upstream
  (`skills-plugins-hooks-agents\plugins_mods`). It accepted and will scope
  it with the owner. The upstream checkout is on branch
  `agent-rules-and-skill-catalog-registration` with uncommitted work in
  flight; nobody builds on it without asking the owner.
- Naming advice given for the mod's next version (owner has not chosen):
  keep `owner-queue` if it stays the queue; `goal-run` if it becomes the
  manager + builders + queue component.

## Planner's report, after this file was first written

- PR #159 merged (`917cd74`): `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` exists (league
  principles, owners first); `CLAUDE.md` has a new first bullet
  "Principles" under Project-wide architectural rules. Main checkout
  pulled to it. Open PRs are now #160 only.
- The owner's rulings to the planner: map #151's docs-only PRs merge on
  green; the upstream repo's uncommitted work is the owner's, leave it;
  roles live in the project (`.claude/agents/central-manager`,
  `central-planner`, `stage-builder`), reusable machinery in the upstream
  plugin. The planner will chart a second wayfinder map for that.
- The planner carries the owner-queue fix into upstream PR #39 (branch
  `owner-queue-mod`), adds a hide/show test, and will copy the tested
  files back over `~/.claude/mods/owner-queue`; it says so before it
  overwrites the loaded copy.

- Later the same morning: the loaded owner-queue copy is synced to
  upstream PR #39 at `36b4218` (version 0.2.0, 6 tests, by the planner's
  report). Any further change to that mod goes through the planner.
- The planner charted map **#162** "Managing-session roles +
  session-dispatch plugin", tickets **#163 to #168** (research, two
  grillings, a prototype, role files in `.claude/agents/`, the upstream
  plugin). No goal run touches #151 to #158 or #162 to #168.

## After the manager's compact (2026-10-12, about 14:40 UTC)

- `main` = `f92de07`: #77 phase 1 merged as PR #161. Main checkout pulled.
- Builder idle, state-back written, waiting for its own compact. Phase 2
  is one local commit on `feat/77-seam-phase2`, not pushed. Its tests:
  692 pass.
- **#109 parked, then answered.** The auditor's question (how pick legs
  inside one trade resolve) went to the owner here; the owner chose
  **(a) in order, hint breaks ties**, which is what PR #160 builds. The
  answer was relayed to the builder with `send_message`; the builder
  records it, removes the entry, rebases #160 and merges on green. If the
  builder wants the owner's own word, the owner confirms in that session.
- Open PRs: #160 (builder), #169 (planner, README, merges on green).
- Planner before its compact: #152, #153 closed; next #155 (touches
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `PLAN.md`), #156 to #158. Map #162: #163 research
  closed; next #164 grilling with the owner. Upstream PR #39 waits for the
  owner's merge. Its pointer file:
  `C:\Users\benha\.claude\plans\look-across-our-project-sorted-candy.md`.
- Later: #169 merged (`e78cb41`, README now links to
  `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/SOURCES.md`, `notebooks/README.md` instead
  of copying them). The planner's #155 PR (`docs/contributing-truth-up`)
  is open and touches `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (memory-layout list
  gains RESUME, GOAL-RUN, NEEDS-OWNER) and `PLAN.md`; merges on green.
  Rebase after it before any edit of those files. It covers part of the
  owed MEMORY index work on the `CLAUDE.md` side only.
- The owner confirmed the owner-queue Hide/Show button works again.
- The planner asked whether seven public-doc claims hold through stage D;
  answered from the ADRs and tickets (new at #108: top-level `supabase/`
  and `migrate.yml`; no new required check; the rest breaks at cutover).
- **Relay rule, owner's ruling 2026-10-12:** "Quoted relay counts, parks
  only". Written into `GOAL-RUN.md` by PR **#172** (branch
  `chore/goal-run-relay-rule`), which waits for the owner's merge. The
  builder and the planner (for map #162's role files) were told. When the
  manager relays: quote question and answer word for word, name the
  entry, and never stretch it past the entry.
- Later still: `main` = `12748c7`. Merged: #171 (#77 phase 2), #170,
  #173 (planner), **#172 (relay rule, owner's go)**. Open: #160 only.
- Builder state: #77 phase 3 built, uncommitted on
  `feat/77-seam-phase3`. **It is stopped: `git commit` was denied three
  times in its session.** Only the owner can allow it there; the manager
  does not commit for it. Remote `feat/77-seam-phase2` still exists.
- Owner's answers relayed after #172 merged: #109 = (a); phase 3 proof =
  "Frame-equal passes, named in the PR" (same parquet column types, same
  frame with dtypes checked, byte differences listed with cause and the
  three column names). The second may not be an entry in
  `NEEDS-OWNER.md`; if not, the builder needs the owner's own word.
- Builder's denied call (not retried): copying `data/raw` into its
  worktree; it reads the main checkout's captures in place.

## Tooling facts found today

- **No session on this machine has `start_session` or
  `hand_off_to_session`** (checked here and in the planner, a session
  created today). Cause unknown. Ways to start a builder: the
  `mcp__ccd_session__spawn_task` chip (one click by the owner; used for
  stage B), or the Claude CLI.
- **Claude CLI installed** by the owner's go, with Anthropic's installer:
  `C:\Users\benha\.local\bin\claude.exe`, 2.1.296, signature valid. The
  owner has put it on PATH (done; the "Put the Claude CLI on PATH" action
  never reached the committed `NEEDS-OWNER.md`). It has `--bg`,
  `--agent`, `--agents`, `-w/--worktree`, `--permission-mode`, `-n`,
  `--plugin-dir`, and `claude agents` / `logs` / `attach` / `stop`. No CLI
  session has been started and its login is unchecked. Never start one
  with permissions skipped.
- **owner-queue mod bug fixed** in the loaded copy only
  (`C:\Users\benha\.claude\mods\owner-queue\hooks\register.tsx`): "Hide
  queue" closed the pane but left the `shown` flag true, so the label
  stuck and later presses did nothing. `hide()` now clears the flag and a
  new `toggle($)` decides by `$.ui.panes()`. `claude plugin validate` and
  `claude plugin test` (5) pass. The owner reloaded plugins; **whether the
  button now works is not confirmed.** The planner was told to carry the
  fix upstream.

## Owed by the manager

- Add ADR-0018, ADR-0019, `GOAL-RUN.md`, `NEEDS-OWNER.md` (and this
  file) to `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`, in a memory PR when no builder PR
  is open.
- Map #69's "Not yet specified" still lists the seam prereqs that #110
  has mostly done; fix the map text (PII-scan first).
- After the owner's `04t` capture: check the owner's claim row carries
  `claim_method = waiver` and a `claim_bid`; then #97 (plan
  `C:\Users\benha\.claude\plans\squishy-toasting-minsky.md`).
- Older, still open: root repo `preferences.md` is uncommitted ("root
  tier changed — commit and push?"); old session `local_2bb79438…` is not
  archived (denied).

## Commit denial in the builder, fixed by the owner (2026-10-12)

- Symptom: `git add` / `git commit` denied with no prompt, six times,
  after working earlier the same day. No deny rule or hook named them;
  best reading is the auto-mode check. Typing "allow" in chat did not
  help.
- Fix, by the owner's hand: a git-ignored
  `.claude/settings.local.json` **in the builder's worktree** with
  `Bash(git add *)` and `Bash(git commit -F *)` under
  `permissions.allow`. Commits then went through: #77 phase 3 merged as
  PR #174 (`7428005`).
- For the builder packet: every new builder worktree needs these two
  allow rules before its first commit (the owner pastes them, or the
  packet's setup step asks for them). Written without a BOM.
- The owner told the builder: "you get your approvals from me through
  dynastyFantasyFootball-central-builder".

## Roles and name (owner, 2026-10-12, afternoon)

- This session is now **`dynastyFantasyFootball-central-builder-manager`**
  (same id). Owner's words: "you pass my words to builders. you are
  builder manager." Planner and builder told.
- #164 role grilling closed (resolution comment on the ticket): manager
  edits `.md` and `.claude/memory/*` only, own PR; event-driven
  check-ins, one look after 60 quiet minutes; closeout once a builder has
  stopped; a denied call is never retried, it parks as an Action;
  builders move to accept-edits plus a committed allow/deny file once
  #166 and #165 are done.
- **PR #176** (`chore/goal-run-roles`, `GOAL-RUN.md` only) carries the
  denied-call rule and "The managing session" section. **The owner
  merges it by hand.** "Session setup" still says auto mode on purpose.
- `main` = `00b3237`: #160 (#109) and #175 (#77 phase 4) merged. Builder
  is on `feat/77-seam-phase5b`.
- A fresh worktree has no `.venv`, so the pre-commit PII hook fails
  there. The manager commits from the main checkout (branch, commit,
  back to `main`) until that is solved; told the planner for #165/#166.
- `git worktree prune` (run once by the manager, should not be repeated)
  tried to drop four stale admin entries under `.git/worktrees/`
  (`agent-a11df4cfac048959e`, `brave-euclid-5d75b2`,
  `elegant-dirac-4c3411`, `youthful-lalande-beec19`) and was refused:
  nothing was deleted. Leave them for the owner.

## Later afternoon, 2026-10-12

- **Commit denial, real cause** (builder's report): the settings deny
  any command that names a login step's file, so `git add <that file>`
  was refused. The owner unblocked it with "run git add -u". My
  auto-mode guess was wrong or incomplete; the local allow file may not
  have been needed. Builders stage with `git add -u`. Planner told.
- #109 closed, PR #160 merged. #77 phase 5 built without the
  `fact_trade_log` write; PR to come.
- **Park answered:** "#77: three whole-number columns of fact_trade_log
  through the seam". Owner chose **(b)**: declare `draft_year`,
  `draft_round`, `pick_in_round` as nullable integers in the registry
  now; `02d` writes them so. Relayed word for word. Asked the builder to
  include the trade tool's `profiles.py` read in its proof.
- Planner: repo description set, #156 and #168 closed; the plugin is
  named `agent-session-managers`, `owner-queue` stays separate as a
  dependency; cutover doc lines are a comment on #93; next is the #165
  prototype, planned with the owner first.
- **Second #77 park answered:** `fact_fantasy_teams` through the seam
  would stop on a rostered player with no `gsis_id`. Owner chose
  **"(c) now, (b) inside #97"**: `02e` keeps its old write; the guard
  test is born with one named exception citing #97; #97 moves the write
  into the seam under `(team_key, scorer_id)` and deletes the exception.
  Relayed word for word. **Stage C brief must carry: remove that guard
  exception in #97.**
- PR #177 = #77 phase 5 (open, builder). Builder goes to #149 next.
- PR #176 still waits for the owner's merge.
- **Stray commit on local `main` in the main checkout:** `7e418b9`
  "proto-165-probe", empty, unpushed, left by the planner's #165
  prototype (a background CLI session that was not moved to its own
  worktree). Local `main` is ahead 1, behind 4, so `git pull --ff-only`
  refuses. The fix is `git reset --soft HEAD~1` while the tip is still
  `7e418b9`. **Resolved:** the owner told the planner to remove it; the
  planner ran the reset; the manager confirmed and pulled, main checkout
  = `1ab9ff6`, level with origin. Planner's finding for session setup: a
  CLI background session gets no worktree of its own unless told to.
- `origin/main` = `1ab9ff6`: #177 (phase 5), #178 (#149), #179 (#86),
  #180 (`fact_trade_log` through the seam, Int64) merged. #109, #149,
  #86 CLOSED. #77 OPEN: phase 6 (guard test) is what is left.

## Dispatch and models (owner's ruling 2026-10-12)

- The owner merged PR #176 (`b707671`): `GOAL-RUN.md` now has the
  denied-call rule and "The managing session".
- Owner, verbatim: "let's make sure that our plan is for YOU to create
  sub-agent sessions in claude cli in powershell directly with
  appropriate model (large work opus 5.5 medium with tightly scoped
  given to sonnett 5.5). note: all models should use equivalent model
  (sonnet/opus) and version (5.5) as available."
- So: **the manager starts builders itself with the Claude CLI from
  PowerShell.** A stage or large work: `--model claude-opus-5-5
  --effort medium`. A tightly scoped task: `--model claude-sonnet-5-5`
  (effort not stated). Always the 5.5 version of the family.
- **Refined the same day into three tiers, chosen in planning** (owner,
  verbatim: "let effort be decided in planning, perhaps if anything may
  need an investigative step but not to opus level. i'm thinking in
  terms of our version of low (sonnet 5.5 medium) - medium (sonnet 5.5
  high) - high (opus 5.5 medium)."):

  | Tier | Command flags | For |
  |---|---|---|
  | low | `--model claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort medium` | tightly scoped work |
  | medium | `--model claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort high` | an investigative step, not Opus level |
  | high | `--model claude-opus-5-5 --effort medium` | a stage, large work |

  The plan or ticket names the tier; the manager does not pick it at
  dispatch. Where the tier is written down is open (planner told).
- Every dispatch carries `-w <name>` (a background CLI session gets no
  worktree otherwise; that is how the stray commit on `main` happened),
  `--bg`, `-n <name>`, and a permission mode that is never bypass. The
  worktree needs a `.venv` before its first commit.
- CLI flags checked on 2.1.296: `--model`, `--effort`, `--bg`, `-w`,
  `--agent`, `--agents`, `--permission-mode`, `--settings`, `-n`,
  `--fallback-model`. Call it by full path from Git Bash
  (`C:\Users\benha\.local\bin\claude.exe`); PowerShell has it.
- **Not started yet:** no CLI session until the dispatch design on map
  #162 (#165, #166) is settled with the owner and the builders' allow
  file exists. Planner told. "Session setup" in `GOAL-RUN.md` still says
  a fresh session set up by the owner in auto mode; that text changes in
  a later PR the owner merges.

## Prototype #165 findings (planner, closed 2026-10-12; evidence on the ticket)

- Start: `claude --bg --name <n> -w <worktree> --model … --effort …`
  from **PowerShell, not Git Bash** (Git Bash turns a leading `/goal`
  into a file path and the goal silently becomes plain text). The CLI is
  logged in.
- Without `-w` the session stays in the main checkout. Check `cwd` in
  `claude agents --json` once the entry has a pid.
- Modes: `default` blocks for good on an unanswered prompt (status
  waiting); `dontAsk` returns denials at once and the builder parks
  cleanly with the exact command.
- **A CLI worktree has no `.claude/settings.json`**, so none of the
  project deny rules (the Fantrax login steps, force push, `--no-verify`)
  apply unless passed with `--settings`. It has no `.venv` either. The
  CLI does copy `settings.local.json` into it. **Never dispatch without
  the deny rules passed in**; this is what #166's builders' file is for.
- The project allow list is wrong for builders (under `dontAsk` it
  allowed `git commit` and denied read-only `git cherry`).
- Watch: `claude agents --json` and the transcript `.jsonl` (it carries
  `goal_status` met true/false); `claude logs` is a raw screen dump.
  Follow up: `claude --resume <sessionId> --bg "<msg>"` from the
  builder's worktree. Clean up: `claude stop`, then `claude rm` (removes
  session, worktree and branch; retry once if "locked").
- An idle session still sits in old worktree folder
  `brave-euclid-5d75b2`; that is why Windows would not delete it.
- Still: no CLI session from the manager until #166 delivers the file.

## STAGE B DONE (2026-10-12, about 16:45 UTC)

- #109, #77, #149, #86 all CLOSED; no open PR; `main` = `origin/main` =
  `93b9138` (#181, #77 phase 6). Re-proved by the manager on `main`:
  `pytest tests/` 754 passed; `tests/test_storage_guard.py` 3 passed;
  `check_data_model.py` OK (34 tables) and `--check` OK;
  `check_sources.py --check` OK; `run_pipeline.py --check-only` 180
  checks, 0 Gate failures, review findings 0 new (1 repeat, 1 cleared).
- Guard exception to remove in #97: the `fact_fantasy_teams` write in
  `02e` (noted on #97 by the builder).
- For stage C (#135): the checks read through `etl.read_stored`, an
  uncast read, because `read_table` casts to the registry and would hide
  drift. The Postgres backend needs the same uncast read.
- **Closeout done 2026-10-12 on the owner's word** ("the builder is
  stopped, do the closeout"); the app showed `isRunning: false`. The
  builder had already merged its own state-back (PR #182, `4278185`), so
  its worktree was clean. Deleted, each with its tip equal to a merged
  PR's head or sitting on `main`: local `chore/149-02a-nflverse-chain`
  (#178), `chore/goal-run-roles` (#176), `chore/resume-stage-b-done`
  (#182), `claude/vigorous-euclid-99dea6`, `feat/109-pick-legs` (#160),
  `feat/77-seam-phase1` (#161), `-phase2` (#171), `-phase3` (#174),
  `-phase4` (#175), `-phase5b` (#177), `feat/77-trade-log-int` (#180),
  `feat/86-nflverse-facts` (#179), `stage-b-done`; remote
  `feat/77-seam-phase2`, `feat/77-seam-phase6` (#181),
  `chore/goal-run-roles`.
- **Left for the owner:**
  - local branch `feat/77-seam-phase5` (two wip commits, no merged PR at
    that tip; superseded by `-phase5b` as far as the names say, not
    proven);
  - the worktree folder `.claude/worktrees/vigorous-euclid-99dea6`:
    `git worktree remove` unregistered it and deleted most of it, then
    Windows refused the rest ("Permission denied"; something still holds
    the folder, likely the stopped session). About 346 files remain,
    among them the `.venv` and ignored run output (public roster
    captures, review CSVs, a draft board workbook), all regenerable. Not
    forced.
- The text below is the state before the closeout, kept as the record.
- Closeout was first held back: the app still showed the builder as running.
  Left as found, for the closeout once it has stopped:
  - worktree `.claude/worktrees/vigorous-euclid-99dea6`, on branch
    `stage-b-done`, with an **uncommitted `RESUME.md` state-back** (stage
    B done) that is not on `main`; it needs a PR before the worktree goes;
  - remote branches `feat/77-seam-phase2`, `feat/77-seam-phase6`, and
    the manager's own `chore/goal-run-roles` (merged as #176);
  - local branches whose remote is gone: `chore/149-02a-nflverse-chain`,
    `feat/109-pick-legs`, `feat/77-seam-phase1`, `-phase3`, `-phase4`,
    `-phase5b`, `feat/77-trade-log-int`, `feat/86-nflverse-facts`; and
    `feat/77-seam-phase2`, `feat/77-seam-phase5`, `stage-b-done`,
    `claude/vigorous-euclid-99dea6`, `chore/goal-run-roles`.
- Next: stage C waits on the owner's `04t` capture (after Thursday
  2026-10-15) and on #166 for how the manager dispatches its builder.

## Planner state at its compact (2026-10-12, late)

- Map #151: all closed. Map #162: open are #166 (role files and the
  builders' allow/deny file) and #167 (plugin, now named
  `session-dispatch-managers-build-review` by the owner; `owner-queue`
  stays a separate dependency).
- Open for the owner before #166: role file name (central-manager or
  builder-manager), builder permission mode (planner will recommend
  `dontAsk` plus a builders' own list), approvals-through-manager versus
  parks-only, where the tier is written down, the `.venv` step.
- Planner's pointer file:
  `C:\Users\benha\.claude\plans\look-across-our-project-sorted-candy.md`.

## For later briefs (from the planner, 2026-10-12)

- **Stage C brief, #108 PR:** the planner consents to one edit of its
  files in that PR. README folder map gains the row
  "| `supabase/` | Database migrations, generated from the table registry
  | [ADR-0018](docs/adr/0018-supabase-schema-and-rls.md) |";
  CONTRIBUTING's tracked table gains "`supabase/`" in the included row
  that lists `scripts/`, `tests/`.
- **Stage D brief:** the planner will list, in a comment on #93, the doc
  lines that flip at cutover (README storage note and "Running the
  pipeline", CONTRIBUTING data-commit section, repo topics). Point the
  cutover step at it.
- Open question for stage C: is `migrate.yml` live before cutover?
- The first seven-claim answer never arrived at the planner (queued,
  then lost over its compact); resent. A queued message can be lost.

## Lessons from this window

- Choice framing the owner confirmed works (2026-10-12, said after the
  #172 / phase 3 questions): each option says what happens next, then
  **WHY** you would pick it, its **COST**, and any **RISK** the manager
  cannot rule out, in plain words. Keep this shape for every decision
  put to the owner, and for the builder packet's park entries.

- A builder in a worktree starts from `origin/main`: an uncommitted
  memory edit in the main checkout never reaches it. Put what it needs in
  its brief or merge it first.
- Two sessions writing `RESUME.md` conflict. One writer per file.
- CI is read once (`gh pr view <n> --json
  mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup`); if it is still running, report
  and stop. `mcp__ccd_pr__get_status` reads the app's cache.
